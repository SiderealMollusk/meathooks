Generators should not have there down directoy because they collapsed into a single file.
I just can't stomach reworking the tests

Test don't cover populating include files. I did have a wierd bug where the file contents were empty at in the first element, and then combined into the second
I expect it will wash out because if it isn't there the issues will be super visable.

Listed project not tested

instantiating meathooks should allow for setting the project
